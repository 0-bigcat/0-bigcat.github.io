My girlfriend is learning html and css recently. I told her to follow the video. Here, I recommend a video in Chinese that suite for new learners. The name of course is Getting HTML web pages dev in 8 hours(8小时学会HTML网页开发). I watched this video at very first time. The teacher named Eighteen Swallows(燕十八). He teached very clear even himself being on screen to show what is float or box-model.    

Here is the site address of the free online video.
